# ElectroBunny Scouting Project‚ö°üê∞

Scouting app for FIRST Robotics Competition for ElectroBunny #1954



## Roadmap
#### 0.0.1
Ok so it's still not a final product and you can't even start scotching yet but right now it contains a lot of very important things First we are rebuilding the entire site for full control over the site and for Albert to be happy To start everything we need a skeleton of the site which is what we are currently working on of course with the skeleton comes the code that gives all the functionality

That's all there is for now
  - a nodejs server that renders the page and keeps the scooter updated at any given time
  - Data transfer between the scooter and the server
  - Full connection of the server to Google services
  - Basic skeleton for the scooter site
  - A multipage form that includes several basic pages to simulate data transfer
